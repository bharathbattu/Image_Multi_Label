# ImageMultiLabel

A **multiclass image classification** project using a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** built with **TensorFlow** to classify images of flowers into four categories.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This project implements a CNN model for multiclass image classification, trained on a dataset of flower images. The model uses TensorFlow and Keras to preprocess images, build a sequential CNN architecture, and train it to classify images into one of four classes. The entire workflow is implemented in a Jupyter Notebook: `ImageMultiLabel.ipynb`.

---

## ✅ Features

- **Dataset**: Flower images organized into four class folders.
- **Preprocessing**: Image augmentation (shear, zoom, horizontal flip) and rescaling.
- **Model**: CNN with three Conv2D layers, MaxPooling layers, and a Dense softmax output.
- **Training**: 20 epochs with Adam optimizer and categorical cross-entropy loss.
- **Evaluation**: Achieved ~71.74% validation accuracy after training.

## ⚙️ Requirements

To run this project, you need the following:

- Python 3.7+
- TensorFlow 2.x
- NumPy
- Jupyter Notebook

Install dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install tensorflow numpy jupyter
````

---

## 📁 Dataset

The dataset contains **431 training images** and **46 validation images**, divided into 4 classes and stored in the directory:

```
C:\Users\Asus\flower
```

Make sure your dataset is structured like this:

```
flower/
├── class1/
├── class2/
├── class3/
├── class4/
```

Update the `base_dir` variable in the notebook to reflect your dataset path.

## 🧠 Model Architecture

The CNN model uses TensorFlow’s Keras API and includes:

* `Conv2D`: 64 filters, 3x3 kernel, stride=2, ReLU, same padding
* `MaxPooling2D`: 2x2 pool size, stride=2
* `Conv2D`: 32 filters, 3x3 kernel, stride=2, ReLU, same padding
* `MaxPooling2D`: 2x2 pool size, stride=2
* `Conv2D`: 32 filters, 3x3 kernel, stride=2, ReLU, same padding
* `MaxPooling2D`: 2x2 pool size
* `Flatten`
* `Dense`: 4 units with softmax activation

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/ImageMultiLabel.git
cd ImageMultiLabel
```

Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Update the `base_dir` variable in `ImageMultiLabel.ipynb` to match your dataset directory.

## 🔮 Future Improvements

* Try deeper models or pre-trained networks like **VGG16**, **ResNet**.
* Increase dataset size or add more aggressive augmentation.
* Tune hyperparameters: learning rate, batch size, etc.
* Add **Dropout layers** to reduce overfitting.
